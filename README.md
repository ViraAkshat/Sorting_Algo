# Sorting_Algo

This repo contains all the different types of sorting algorithm

## Bubble Sort

Float the smallest value to the front or the largest value to the end; one by one by comparing adjacent values and swapping accordingly
Time complexity:

- O(N^2) for worst case
- O(N) for best case

## Selection Sort

Find the minimum element in the unsorted region of array, swap it with the first element in unsorted array, repeat
Time complexity

- O(N^2)

## Insertion Sort

Check if the current element and the previously scanned part of array is sorted or not. if not the sort by swapping the current element with adjacent element(s) till it gets sorted
Time complexity

- O(N^2)

## Merge Sort

Divide the array into smaller segments until you reach single unit. Now, merge the divided array in sorted form. Select the divided half arrays, compare each element and keep adding the next smaller number to a temp array. Finally, change the original array, recursively
Time Complexity

- O(NlogN)
