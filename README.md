# Sorting_Algo

This repo contains all the different types of sorting algorithm

## Bubble Sort

Float the smallest value to the front or the largest value to the end; one by one by comparing adjacent values and swapping accordingly
Time complexity:

- O(N^2) for worst case
- O(N) for best case

## Selection Sort

Find the minimum element in the unsorted region of array, swap it with the first element in unsorted array, repeat
Time complexity

- O(N^2)
