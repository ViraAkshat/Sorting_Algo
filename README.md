# Sorting_Algo

This repo contains all the different types of sorting algorithm

## Bubble Sort

Float the smallest value to the front or the largest value to the end; one by one by comparing adjacent values and swapping accordingly
Time complexity:

- O(N^2) for worst case
- O(N) for best case

## Selection Sort

Find the minimum element in the unsorted region of array, swap it with the first element in unsorted array, repeat
Time complexity

- O(N^2)

## Insertion Sort

Check if the current element and the previously scanned part of array is sorted or not. if not the sort by swapping the current element with adjacent element(s) till it gets sorted
Time complexity

- O(N^2)
